                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ Abdul Qadeer Khan (A.Q. Kahn) was born on April 1, 1936, in Bhopal, India. As a Muslim, Khan
                immigrated to Pakistan in 1952.<br><br>
                ☛ He earned his doctorate in metallurgical engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in
                Belgium. There he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and
                isotope separation based on gas centrifuges.<br><br>
                ☛ He then began working at Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory, a subcontractor of the Dutch partner
                of URENCO. URENCO, a consortium of British, German, and Dutch companies, was established in 1971 to
                research and develop uranium enrichment through the use of ultracentrifuges, which are centrifuges that
                operate at extremely high speeds. Khan used this position to steal drawings of centrifuges and assembled
                a list of mainly European suppliers where those parts could be procured.<br><br>
                ☛ On January 31, 2004, Khan was arrested for transferring nuclear technology to other countries. On
                February 4 he read a statement on Pakistani television taking full responsibility for his operations and
                absolving the military and government of any involvement—a claim that many nuclear experts found
                difficult to believe. The next day he was pardoned by Pakistan’s president, Pervez Musharraf. In 2009,
                his verdict was declared unconstitutional by the Islamabad High Court.<br><br>
                ☛ On October 10, 2021, Khan died at the age of 85 in Islamabad after being transferred to a hospital
                after he tested positive for COVID-19 in August. He was given a state funeral at the Faisal Mosque
                before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.<br><br>
